Unfortunately, The Accursed are prepared, having fortified their base entrance with a mix of units and defensive structures.</center></font></td><td width=320><font face="arial,helvetica" size=-1>In most RTSes, players spend only a very small fraction of their time involved in a battle.  Most RTS battles are resolved quickly, and involve huge amounts of 
troops which quickly annihilate each other.  Most of a players time is spent 
preparing for a battle, and not actually in a battle.  Even when there is a battle, in most RTSes, players 
don't usually have much opportunity to respond to situations in a battle, or engage in any 
sophisticated strategies on the tactical level.  Strifeshadow is built with the 
philosophy that battles are the most rewarding part of an RTS game.
<p>
Battles in Strifeshadow are a frequent occurrence, in which tactical moves, such as 
feints, pronged attacks and various types of ambushes are all viable.  In other words, 
battles are of higher quantity as well as quality in Strifeshadow.</td></tr></table>

<p>
In order to accomplish this, we have done two things, one to encourage battle quantity, 
and one to establish battle quality.  To encourage a large number of battles, we have 
designed the resource system to be primarily a system of networked towers.  Because 
these towers branch off over great distances, there are many points at which a player can 
be attacked, and as a result, many small attacks rather than one or two large attacks 
are typically favored.  This constrasts with most RTSes which tend to have more localized resource centers, and in turn favor large confrontations.
<p>
Another distinction in our resource system is that incremental expansion, namely 
bringing in a slight additional flow of resources, requires incremental exposure.  
In most other RTSes, such as Command and Conquer(tm) or Starcraft(tm), incremental expansion, 
such as building a harvester or peon unit, results in little or no additional exposure.  This 
incremental exposure forms the basis for a lot of small-scale attacks that wouldn't 
otherwise be present under a more traditional resource system.
<p>
<table width=620><tr><td width=370>
<font face=arial,helvetica size=-1>
Strifeshadow has several features which make the battles particularly interesting.  
The first is that units take addition damage from the side and rear.  This makes 
positional advantages much more strong than in other games, and provides part of the 
framework for a number of strategies, such as ambushing and pronged attacks. 
<p>
There is 
also an engagement feature, which is used by infantry units.  This allows infantry 
units to act as a shield for other units by engaging aggressors in combat.  Engagement 
is an ability with which a unit can "trap" another unit in combat, preventing it 
from easily breaking off and doing something else.  This property in turn results in 
wiggling about trying to get around infantry screens -- in other words it makes the 
battle more involved.  This differs from other games, in which the player can typically 
run past any troops in the way, virtually ignoring them.  </td><td width=250><img src="gfx/battle-2.jpg"><br><center><font face=arial,helvetica size=-2> Skeletal slashers pin down Gremlin Carvers and Moor Moags, while Spectral Archers

<p><table width=620><tr><td width=350><img src="gfx/battle-3.jpg"><br><center><font face=arial,helvetica size=-2>A mix of units is among the keys to victory 
in Strifeshadow.  In this screen, a tainted wisp supports a shielded Fell 
Dragon and several Dark Locusts while they fight several powerful Chaos creatures.</center></font></td><td width=270><font face=arial,helvetica size=-1>
The third 
part of Strifeshadow's battle-oriented feature set is inherent to our unit design and 
counterability.  Units and unit mixes have a number of counters, most 
of which require a smart tactical play on the part of the player to take advantage of.  
For instance, ranged units and infantry together counter just infantry when used blindly, 
but if the player with just infantry splits his forces, he might be able to get at the 
ranged units without being screened.  To counter this the player with ranged and infantry 
could in turn split his infantry to try to counter the split.<p>  Another example is in the 
use of Dire Changlings.  In order to use Dire Changlings properly, the player must morph 
them to an immobile form which does grievous damage to infantry units.  However, the 
infantry units must be really close when this happens, otherwise little damage is dealt.  
A popular strategy to get Dire Changlings to work well is to morph them after friendly 
infantry units have engaged the opponents infantry units, preventing an easy escape.</td></tr></table>
